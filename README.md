# Technical Assignment

This is a first technical assignment for the data engineer / data scientist position at CREA.

## Part 1 - Data analysis and visualisation (30-min)
We at CREA have developed an online system that collects air pollution data from a dozen sources globally. In this assignment, we would like you to extract and present some insights using this dataset.

Namely, we would like you to present in a single graph (subplots/facets authorised) the share of population covered by PM10 monitoring stations within radii of 5, 10, 50km for US, UK, Turkey, Thailand, Philippines, and India.

Data sources:
- Stations: https://api.energyandcleanair.org/stations?country=GB,US,TR,PH,IN,TH
- Population data: [data/gpw_v4_population_density_rev11_2020_15_min.tif](data/gpw_v4_population_density_rev11_2020_15_min.tif)

You can use either R or Python for data analysis, and any library or platform to create charts, except Tableau and PowerBI. Code and results can be hosted on a Markdown document, Jupyter notebook, R markdown, simple code and image files, or interactive web page.

Please don't spend more than 30 minutes on this task.

## Comments

We are interested in the way you solve the problems, how you structure your code and how you present results. There             is no particular trap. If you have any doubt or question, feel free to contact [me](hubert@energyandcleanair.org) directly.
